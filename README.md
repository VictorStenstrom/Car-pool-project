# Car-pool-project

This project is a carpool website that I created using a predefined template. The website allows users to view the latest rental car offers and get an overview of where they are available.

## Technologies used in addition to the template include:

* Easyweb CMS 
* HTML & SASS for structure and design.
* JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content.
* API consumption to retrieve location information.
* Responsive design that adapts to the user's device.

## The website's features include:

1. View the latest rental car offers for individuals or organizations.
2. Navigate the map to see available cars that fit your needs and preferences.
3. Fill in the contact form with your details and communicate with the company.
4. View the latest news.

If you want to develop or modify this carpool website to fit your own needs, you can download the code from GitHub and make changes according to your own preferences.

I hope that this code example will be useful for Easyweb developers, both old and new.
